## 📘 **What I Learned in 5 Days (AI Agents Intensive Course)**

During the 5-day AI Agents course, I learned how to build structured, modular, and intelligent multi-agent systems. Key learnings include:

### **Day 1 — Foundations of Agents**

* Understanding what an agent is
* Agent loops, reasoning steps, and state
* Tools, actions, memory, and agent ↔ environment interaction

### **Day 2 — Tool Integration**

* How agents call tools
* Function tools, Google search tools, external APIs
* Error handling & retry patterns
* Building reliable tool-calling agents

### **Day 3 — Context Engineering**

* Structured prompts
* Sessions, memory, and maintaining long conversations
* Using state to pass data between agents
* Creating contextual workflows

### **Day 4 — Multi-Agent Workflows**

* Sequential agents
* Parallel agents
* Coordinator (root) agents
* Multi-step reasoning pipelines
* Designing agent roles that depend on each other

### **Day 5 — Capstone Architecture**

* Turning multiple agents into one final pipeline
* Orchestrating inputs → agents → final stitched output
* Building a demo notebook
* Submitting to Kaggle with readable output

## 🧩 **Problem Statement**

People often experience emotions like sadness, fear, anger, or powerlessness but lack a supportive framework that acknowledges their feelings, offers cultural grounding, and provides small, actionable steps.

Modern emotional AI tools often feel generic or distant.
Meanwhile, Indian spiritual traditions—Bhagavad Gita, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Upanishads—carry deep emotional wisdom, but are rarely integrated into personalized digital systems.

**iGita explores how AI agents can bridge these worlds** to offer gentle emotional insight, compassionate reframing, mythic guidance, and mindful micro-actions.

## 🤖 **Why Agents?**

Emotions are multi-layered. No single model can:

* detect emotion,
* recall past patterns,
* generate empathy,
* craft mythological metaphors,
* provide Sanskrit reflections,
* and recommend mindful practices

all at once.

A **multi-agent system** allows:

### ✓ Separation of roles

Each agent specializes (emotion sensing, memory, storytelling, wisdom…).

### ✓ Modular reasoning

Each agent passes its context to the next, forming a human-like flow.

### ✓ Natural emotional processing

Sense → Reflect → Contextualize → Find Meaning → Act

### ✓ Expandability

More agents can be added anytime without breaking the system.

# 🛕 **Architecture Overview**

### **Agents in the System**

1. **EmotionSenseAgent**
   Interprets emotional tone and cognitive bias.

2. **MemoryAgent**
   Recalls emotionally similar patterns from the session.

3. **ReframerCompanionAgent**
   Produces a warm, empathetic emotional reframe.

4. **MythicMotivationAgent**
   Creates an Indian epic–inspired motivational story.

5. **WisdomAgent**
   Generates a Sanskrit-style verse with a modern reflection.

6. **DailyTrackerAgent**
   Suggests a small 5-minute practice for grounding.

### **Pipeline Flow**

**User Input → Emotion → Memory → Reframe → Mythic Story → Sanskrit Wisdom → Micro-Action → Final Combined Response**

All stitched into a **single, flowing, human-readable emotional companion message**.

# 🛠️ **The Build**

### **Tools & Technologies**

* Python
* Kaggle Notebook
* Prompt-based pseudo agents
* Local state + memory store
* No external API calls (Kaggle-safe execution)

### **Implementation Summary**

* Created lightweight agent functions to simulate LLM-like behavior
* Each agent transforms input → output based on short task prompts
* Built a central pipeline to orchestrate the chain
* Saved final text output to `/kaggle/working/final_spiritual_agent_output.txt`
* Ensured the entire system is reproducible and offline-compatible

* Use actual Mahabharata/Ramayana verses with citations
* Build long-term emotional memory
* Add voice input + tone detection
* Build a simple web UI for iGita
* Personalize guidance based on Bhakti, Advaita, or Buddhist traditions
* Add meditation audio generation
